# Deep Learning Tools

Plan:
- What I can't see in Lightning is the experiment manager
  that I have, and the grid/random search.
- So I wrap a bunch of lightning code with this higher
  level stuff.
- Outstanding questions:
  * How do params work in lightning?
  * How to replace my Metric with theirs?
